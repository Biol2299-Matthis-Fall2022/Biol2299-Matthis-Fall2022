## SI Units
Different units are used as a standard measurement; there is so much that can be measured, so there are many different unitsto be used accordingly
* units used depends on what is being measured, what the measurement is for, the person measuring it, location, etc.

(Standard Internationality)

* meter = the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second
    * this definition used for maximum precision
* seconds = measured from radioactive oscillation of cesium
* base numbers that everything is measured in 
* imperial system is meant to use easily factorable numbers (12, 60) for everyday use (not necessarily scientific)
* 1 liter of water weighs 1 kg (kg is standard unit for mass)
* 1L = 1000g/1000mL/1000cm^3
* 0K impossible to achieve
* 0K=-273C/32F


## Center of Mass  - for the study of human movement
* mass never changes, but pounds do based on gravitational force
    * mass = the "stuff inside you" (kg)
* pounds are a measure of force against the ground
* Newton's Laws
    * Newton's First Law: inertia, objects in motion stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force
    * Newton's Second Law: Force = Mass x Acceleration
    * Newton's Third Law: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
* kgm/s^2= Newton!

* derived from SI units, keep building up from base level things
