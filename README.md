## Course description

Understanding the neural underpinnings of real-world natural behavior is (one of) the primary desiderata of neuroscience, but technological and methodological constrains limit the vast majority of research to highly artificial and constrained laboratory environments. This course will consider the study of natural behavior from a variety of angles - 

- **Philosophical** - What is the relationship between the (imperfect) measurements of our scientific tools and the actual True Facts of the Universe?
- **Technological** - What tools exist for the study of real-world behavior? What new technologies may arise to assist with this study (and who will own them)?
- **Scientific** - What insights can be gained from existing lab-based research from the various disciplines included in the broad, vague umbrella of "natural behavior" (e.g. neuroscience, biology, biomechanics, robotics, etc)

Students will gain significant experience with the process of locating and efficiently interpreting the key results of primary research articles on a wide range of cross-disciplinary topics, as well as an introduction to emerging open-source/open-science methodologies and Python-based data analysis.

Class discussions will include a through-line of recurring, intersectional analysis of the ways that structural inequities inherent to our existing instructions of science and technology have shaped the past, present, and (if we don't do something about it) future of scientific inquiry.
