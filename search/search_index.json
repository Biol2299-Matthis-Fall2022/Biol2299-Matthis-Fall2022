This course will consider the study of natural behavior from a variety of angles - Philosophical - What is the relationship between the (imperfect) measurements of our scientific tools and the actual True Facts of the Universe? Technological - What tools exist for the study of real-world behavior? What new technologies may arise to assist with this study (and who will own them)? Scientific - What insights can be gained from existing lab-based research from the various disciplines included in the broad, vague umbrella of \"natural behavior\" (e.g. neuroscience, biology, biomechanics, robotics, etc) Students will gain significant experience with the process of locating and efficiently interpreting the key results of primary research articles on a wide range of cross-disciplinary topics, as well as an introduction to emerging open-source/open-science methodologies and Python-based data analysis. Class discussions will include a through-line of recurring, intersectional analysis of the ways that structural inequities inherent to our existing instructions of science and technology have shaped the past, present, and (if we don't do something about it) future of scientific inquiry. Learning Outcomes \u2b50 Navigating scientific literature: - Locate a scientific paper from a citation, DOI, or PMID - Identify critical information about it - Rapidly extract the key findings and insights - Evaluate figures to understand how research draw conclusions from data - Differentiate between primary research articles and review articles - Enter the publication into a citation management software - Software: Zotero - Generate citations in written documents Technical skill development: - Markdown text editing - Software: Obsidian.md - Web-based tool: hackmd.io - Basic Github navigation - Web-based tool: github.com - Cloning local copies of repositories - Installing dependencies - Commits - Pull requests - Basic Python data analysis - Web-based tool: Google Colab - Software: PyCharm Grading Your grade from this class will be out of 100 points: - Exam #1 - 25pts - Exam #2 - 25pts - Exam #3 - 25pts - Poster Presentation - 25pts In addition, extra credit points will be awarded liberally for in and out of class participation.
