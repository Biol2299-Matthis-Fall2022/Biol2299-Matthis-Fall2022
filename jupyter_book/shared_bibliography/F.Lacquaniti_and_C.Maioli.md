## Brief Summary
```
 1. What did they do (what activities)? 
 2. What did they measure (what data)?
 3. What did they find (what results)?
 4. What does it mean (what new knowledge)?
```
1. cat on platform while weight distribution, platform angle, and load attachment (center of mass) were changed
2. limb positions and contact fores
3. limb geometry was reserved unchaged, whereas kinetic parameters were severely affected when the load has limited contact but when the load has contact with most of the body it causes irregular balance and limb geomentry is affected
4. independent control of limb geometry and contact forces
