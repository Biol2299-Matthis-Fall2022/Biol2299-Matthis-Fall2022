## Lesson Plan

- How to review pull requests
    - Start with Jon's
    - Then group up and do each others
        - Work until all open PR's are eligible to merge to main :sparkles: 
- Group work - add to the shared bibliography
    - Groups of 2
    - Round 1
        - One person volunteers to be the `Contributor`
            - Only that `Contributor` is allowed to type
        - Create HackMD note
        - Copy 'article_review' template
        - Find a paper and make the summary `.md`
        - Push the new article to the Github Repo
            - push it to a new branch called:
                - [typing_person_first_name]/[in_text_citation_with_no_spaces]
                - e.g. `jon/daley_et_al_2006`
    - Round 2
        - Shuffle groups!
        - Whoever was not a `Contibutor` last round is now a `Maintainer`
        - Work together to do (at least) 2 reviews of the open PR's
            - The `Maintainer` people will write the actual PR reviews
            - Make helpful suggestions to make the summaries as good as they can be (within the available effort)
        - `Contributors` from the previous round should keep an eye out for incoming reviews on their PR's
        - Work collaboratively as a class until all open PR's are merged (or closed)
        - **When possible, the person who made the contribution should merge the commit**
