## Intro to The Situation

### Skepticism and the Philosophy of Science

- Solipsism, the worst and only defensible philosophical position
    - The belief that only I exist and everything else is not real (everyone else = npc)
    - defensible, because only thing you can make assumptions (that others are also conscious)
- Cogito Ergo Sum (1st level of knowledge)
    - "I think, therefore I am"--> only known fact ever is that you are having a conscious experience (not a functional belief)
    - Descartes
    "Essentially Solipism"
    -have to believe untrue things to get anywhere such as others also exist (2nd level of knowledge)
- truth vs Truth
    - Rule#1 - Science is impossible
        - we want to get to Truth, but will never know anything for sure, many scientific theories proven false over the years, any theories now may be proven wrong in the future
        - we get "less wrong" over time
            - ex: optic study by Ibn al-Haytham --> anatomically correct, but lack of explanation for bending of light in lens
            - "fractional/gradients" of truth 
        - no claim is possible without assumptions
    - first assumption: others exist and have conscious experiences
    - Truth - true facts of the universe and how everything works, "God eye view of the world"
        - we can't access this -> only have approximations of truth --> essential gap between epistemology (ability to know things) and metaphysics (True facts)
    - truth - approximations of the truth
    - Knowledge is messy-->interpretations
        - textbooks don't take this into consideration
- Khunian paradigm shifts
    -opposed incrementalist approach: the idea that things get better over time
    - Thomas Khun - The Structure of Scientific Evolutions
    - ex. with phlogiston, pre pre cursor to chemistry (now known as oxygen) 
    - people tend to ignore holes of a study until a new one comes along, causing them to forget the older studies
    - nonlinear progress, where we build "knowledge" from shaky foundations

- Epistemology: the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge, "what does it mean to know something?" "where does it come from?"
- ability to know these things

- Metaphysics: the true facts of the universe & what actually exists
    - ex. where do all of your beliefs about yourself come from?
-Descartes: Empirical fact- something you look at and are reliable bc of that

2 scientific questions: "what am I" and "what is everything else in the world"
- Descartes: "what can I know for sure? bc sensory intake can be wrong"--> we only know we perceive


--> the actual true fact of an experience is always imperfect because time has passed since the recorded data (measurements are imperfect)
### The structure of Academia
- The heirarchy
    - undergrad
    - grad
    - post doc
    - prof
        - tenure and non-tenure track
        - asst prof
        - associate prof
        - 'full' prof
- The journal system 
    - mention markdown
    - peer review
    - "impact factor" and "H-index"
        - "once a metric becomes an outcome, it ceases to be a good metric"
- Funding
    - Federal funds
        - NIH
        - NSF
        - etc
    - Private Foundations
        - HHMI
        - Sloan
        - Etc
    - Corporate
    - Military
