- Look at data from last time
    - daley paper and how to skim
    - volition = the faculty or power of using one's will
    - kinematics = mechanics focused on motions of objects without reference to forces that cause motion
    - center of mass = description of current state of body 
        - ex. moving arms upwards makes center of mass higher up on torso
    - Blender
        - Google - "Blender 3.0 Donut Tutorial"
- Zotero and citation stuff
    - zotero.org
        - converts enl files to plain text
            - either drag pdf into zotero or copy doi url thing and add item by identifier 
    - How to get papers:
        - PubMed
        - Google Scholar
            - good for finding professors' research endeavors 
        - Sci-hub to get the pdf if you're into that
- Neuromechanics paper
    - citation:
        - here in class, we looked at this review article that talked about frogs among other things (Nishikawa et al., 2007)
        - references cited
        - Nishikawa, K., Biewener, A. A., Aerts, P., Ahn, A. N., Chiel, H. J., Daley, M. A., Daniel, T. L., Full, R. J., Hale, M. E., Hedrick, T. L., Lappin, A. K., Nichols, T. R., Quinn, R. D., Satterlie, R. A., & Szymik, B. (2007). Neuromechanics: An integrative approach for understanding motor control.

    - neuromechanics=when thought becomes movement
    - review= overview of topic based on existing sources
