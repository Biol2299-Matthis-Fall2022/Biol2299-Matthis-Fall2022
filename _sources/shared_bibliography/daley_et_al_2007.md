 1. Researchers had Guinea Fowl run across a runway with a false floor that caused an unexpected drop onto a force plate. 
 2. They measured the way that the bird's joints responded to the unexpected drop with motion capture (kinematics) and force plates (kinetics)
 3. They found that the lower joints (ankle and TMP) responded in a feedback-like way to the perturbation, but the bigger, more proximal joints continued their movements if the drop didn't happen.
 4. They suggest that proximal (hip, knee) and distal (ankle, TMP) joints respond to perturbations differently, which allows for more robust responses to unexpected pertrubations
