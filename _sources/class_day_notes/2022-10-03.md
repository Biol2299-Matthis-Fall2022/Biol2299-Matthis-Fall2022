## Lesson plan
### take a peek at data from last time
- TDW data:
    - Data available here - https://www.dropbox.com/sh/j8e8a49jw17naow/AABaXKmqJCZnqX41DmfARBGva?dl=0
  - Blender
  - Jupyter
### Activity 
in groups (keeping notes in a `hackmd` document): 
#### Brainstorm about the data:
 - **Generate Predictions for what the data from the different conditions will look like when visualized**
 - **Find papers that are are relevant to the data we connected**
   - Feel free to use either the reviews we have already located or find your own
   - Add new papers to the Zotero group library
   - Push notes to GitHub repo
   - Write them up in `hackmd` file in the group
 #### Push to Github - 
   - create new branch (call it `{your_name}/com_preditions`)
   - create new file in `docs\standing_posture_research_project\{group_name}_predictions.md`
   - Push your changes to that branch
   - Go to Github and create a Pull Request
   - Review your peers' Pull Requests
     - Each Group should review 2 other groups' Pull Requests
     - Add comments
