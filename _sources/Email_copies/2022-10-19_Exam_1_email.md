**Details** -

- It's an online exam, so you don't need to physically come into the class room if you don't want to. 
    - However, I will be our classroom during our normal class time, so you're more than welcome to take the test in the classroom if you'd like me around to help out with technical questions and whatnot. 
    - I plan to take the exam period to work on the data analysis pipeline for the `COM/BOS` data we collected in class, so feel welcome (but not obligated) to come by if you want to see what that looks like

- You won't be *required* to do any kind of `hackmd` or `github` stuff for this exam, but there will be some kind of wacky extra credit thing associated with y'all making/merging successful pull requests (PR's) onto the `main` branch of our class repo. 

    - I'll nail down the details before class, but I'm thinking something along the lines of "Successful PR's to `main` will provide `X` **shared extra credit** points for everyone in the class" kinda thing. 
    - If `anyone` receives a grade over 100 on this exam, the excess points will roll over onto *everyone's* grade for `Exam#2`.
    - Please note that this is clearly a highly gameable system and I encourage you all to cheese the hell out of it ;)
