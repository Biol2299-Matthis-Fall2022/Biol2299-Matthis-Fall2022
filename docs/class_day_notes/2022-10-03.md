   - Write them up in `hackmd` file in the group
 #### Push to Github - 
   - create new branch (call it `{your_name}/com_preditions`)
   - create new file in `docs\standing_posture_research_project\{group_name}_predictions.md`
   - Push your changes to that branch
   - Go to Github and create a Pull Request
